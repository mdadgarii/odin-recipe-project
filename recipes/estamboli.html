    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A nice rice dish of many names and green beans. I grew up calling it "estamboli", but another appropriate name is "lubia polo" AKA green bean rice. </p>
        <p>Most, if not all, Persian dishes can be made vegetarian.</p>
        <p>As this is a test website, I will be pulling from other websites for the recipes.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 Cups Basmati Rice</li>
    <li>1 Lb (453g) Cut Green Beans</li> 
    <li>1 Lb (453g) Ground Beef or Impossible Ground Beef</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp Oil</li> 
    <li>1 Small diced Onion</li>
    <li>Salt, Turmeric, Ground Chili Pepper</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp Tomato Paste</li> 
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare your rice. <a href="index.html">See our guide to washing rice on the Homepage.</a>
    </li>
    <li>Put the string beans in a pot and add boiling water to it until it covers them all, cover the lid and simmer for 10 min until the beans are tender.</li> 
<li>Heat the vegetable oil in a pot, add the diced onions until translucent.</li>
<li>Add the ground beef to the onion pot, stir and let fry until the beef becomes brown. Add salt, turmeric and ground chili pepper, add tomato paste, mix thoroughly.</li> 
<li>Drain the string beans and add it up to the beef pot. Mix well and leave it over low heat for few minutes (while preparing the next steps).</li>
<li>Simmer the rice until tender, Drain the rice in a colander.</li>
<li> In a large pot, add the rice and the beef mixture into this pot in layers. Stir the top two layers (last layer of rice and the beef mixture).</li>
<li>Add 2 Tbsp vegetable oil, cover the pot with a large napkin and the lid.</li> 
<li>Cook for 30 minutes over low heat.</li>  
</ol>
